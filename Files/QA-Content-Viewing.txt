     WHERE brand = 'acorn'
     AND distributor = 'apple'
     AND country_code = 'us'

         FROM DIM_RAG_MODEL_TITLE
         WHERE lower(SERIES) = 'dark winds'
         GROUP BY SERIES
     )
     SELECT t.SEASON_NUMBER,
         SUM(v.NUMBER_STREAMED) AS total_number_streams
     FROM V_FCT_RAG_MODEL_CONTENT_VIEWS_MOCK v
     INNER JOIN DIM_RAG_MODEL_TITLE t
     ON v.EPISODE_ID = t.EPISODE_ID
     INNER JOIN Latest_Season ls
     ON t.SERIES = ls.SERIES 
     AND t.SEASON_NUMBER = ls.LATEST_SEASON_NUMBER
     WHERE lower(v.country_code) = 'us'
     AND v.month = '09'
     AND v.year = 2024
     AND lower(t.SERIES) = 'dark winds'
